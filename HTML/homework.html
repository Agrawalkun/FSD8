        About the book
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Bhagavad Gita , often refered to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture , which is part of the epic Mahabharat. It forms the chapter 23-40 of book 6 of the Mahabharat called the Bhishma Parva. The work is dated to the second half of the first miliennium BCE.It is wrote by the Maharishi Veda Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita presents a synthesis of various Hindu ideas about dharma, theistic bhakti and the yogic ideal of moksha.In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna teaches that one can kll only body, the soul is immortal. At death, the soul is reborn in another body or for those who have fully grapsed the true teachings, it achieves release(moksha) or extinction(nirvana)- that is, freedom from the wheel of rebirth.
        <p>
            The Bhagavad Gita is such an important scripture that it can help us to get out of the cycle of birth and death.Anyone who can recites Bhagavad Gita with devotion will go to the spritual world at the time of death. If one reads Bhagavad Gita sincerely the reaction of one's past deeds will not act upon one.
